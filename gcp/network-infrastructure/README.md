This repository contains a comprehensive set of Terraform configurations that define a well-structured Google Cloud Platform (GCP) infrastructure. The code orchestrates the creation of networking components, security rules, and virtual machine instances, providing a robust foundation for deploying and managing applications within the GCP environment.

**Key Offering:**

**Network Infrastructure:**
The code establishes a fully-configurable network structure using the google_compute_network and google_compute_subnetwork resources. This setup allows for isolation, scalability, and efficient resource allocation within the network.

R**outing and NAT Management:**
By utilizing the google_compute_router and google_compute_router_nat resources, the code facilitates routing and Network Address Translation (NAT) configuration. This enables seamless communication between instances and external networks while maintaining security.

**Static IP Management:**
The inclusion of the google_compute_address resource empowers users to allocate static IP addresses that can be associated with various resources, ensuring consistent external access and avoiding IP changes.

**Comprehensive Firewall Control:**
Through the google_compute_firewall resources, the code defines both ingress and egress firewall rules. This feature enables granular control over network traffic, enhancing security by allowing only authorized communication.

**Virtual Machine Provisioning:**
The google_compute_instance resource empowers users to effortlessly deploy virtual machine instances. The code defines attributes such as machine type, boot disk configuration, network interfaces, and metadata, simplifying instance management.
